# datastruct

Based on assignment 

Implement some of the whiteboard problems in the data structures arrays - dictionaries- big oh- slides (These can be found under the Files section of Canvas)

Specifically:

re-implement: Push, Pop, Shift, and Unshift for Array.prototype, without using any library functions. Also add some Mocha tests to verify correctness.

unique: implement a function called unique. It takes an array and returns a copy of the array with all the duplicates removed.

frequency: given an array of english words, figure out what the most common letter (anywhere in a word) is. So each occurrence of a letter in a word only counts once for that work. So for [ 'dog', 'book', 'cat', 'box' ] the letter o occurs in 3 words (not 4 times).
